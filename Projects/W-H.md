# Wiring Harness

The wiring harness is an essential component of the Baja SAE vehicle, serving as the central hub for connecting various electrical systems and ensuring reliable communication throughout the vehicle. This harness encompasses two primary circuits: the Killswitch circuit and the Main circuit.

## Killswitch Circuit

The Killswitch circuit is designed to enhance the safety of the driver and the vehicle. In compliance with the Baja SAE 2024 rulebook, rule **(B.10.3)** mandates that a killswitch must be installed in a location that is easily accessible to the driver and can also be operated by a person outside the vehicle. This circuit provides a quick and effective means to immediately cut power to the vehicle's systems in the event of an emergency, thereby preventing potential hazards or accidents during operation. The vehicle is equipped with two kill switches for engine cutoff: one within the driver's reach in the cockpit and an external one accessible to track workers. 

- **SW1**: This killswitch is located within the driver's reach in the cockpit, allowing the driver to quickly disable the engine in case of an emergency.
- **SW2**: This external killswitch is accessible to track workers, ensuring that personnel outside the vehicle can also cut power to the systems if necessary.

## Main Circuit

The Main circuit integrates critical systems, including brake sensors and the brake light, as well as controls for the front differential. The brake sensors are vital for monitoring the vehicle's braking performance. When the driver engages the brakes, the brake pressure sensor activates the brake light, alerting other drivers and spectators that the vehicle is slowing down or stopping. As specified in rule **(B.10.4)**, the vehicle uses an approved brake light positioned for optimal visibility to trailing drivers, activated solely by the hydraulic pressure switch in the brake system.

- **SW3**: This sensor monitors brake pressure and is responsible for activating the brake light when the driver applies the brakes.
- **SW4**: This additional brake sensor serves as a redundant safety measure, ensuring reliable operation of the brake light system.

In addition to the braking system, the Main circuit also controls the front differential through a STSP (Single Throw Single Pole) switch. This feature allows the driver to engage or disengage power to the front wheels as needed, improving maneuverability and traction in various driving conditions. By effectively managing the engagement of the front differential, the driver can optimize vehicle performance across different terrains, ensuring better handling and stability during competitive events.

- **SW5**: This switch allows the driver to engage or disengage power to the front wheels as needed, improving maneuverability and traction in various driving conditions. By effectively managing the engagement of the front differential, the driver can optimize vehicle performance across different terrains, ensuring better handling and stability during competitive events.

The wiring harness plays a critical role in integrating these essential circuits, promoting both safety and functionality in the Baja SAE vehicle's design. This documentation will continue to evolve as we refine the Electronics and Controls subsystems to ensure compliance with Baja SAE specifications while enhancing overall performance.
