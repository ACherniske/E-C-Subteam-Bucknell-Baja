# Wiring Harness

The wiring harness is a crucial component of the Baja SAE vehicle, serving as the central nervous system that connects various electrical systems and ensures reliable communication between them. This harness includes two primary circuits: the Killswitch circuit and the Brake circuit.

## Killswitch Circuit

The Killswitch circuit is designed to ensure the safety of the driver and the vehicle. According to the Baja SAE 2024 rulebook, rule **(B.10.3)** specifies that a killswitch must be installed in a location that is easily accessible to the driver and operable by a person outside the vehicle. This circuit provides a means to immediately cut power to the vehicle's systems in case of an emergency, preventing any potential hazards or accidents during operation. The vehicle is equipped with two kill switches for engine cutoff—one within the driver’s reach in the cockpit and an external one accessible to track workers.

## Brake Circuit

The Brake circuit incorporates brake sensors that detect when the driver applies the brakes. The brake pressure sensor completes the brake circuit; when the driver engages the brakes, the sensor activates the brake light, alerting other drivers and spectators that the vehicle is slowing down or stopping. As outlined in rule **(B.10.4)**, the vehicle uses an approved brake light positioned for visibility to trailing drivers, activated exclusively by this hydraulic pressure switch on the brake system.

The wiring harness is essential for integrating these systems, ensuring both functionality and safety in the Baja SAE car's design. This document will evolve as we continue refining the Electronics and Controls subsystems to ensure compliance with Baja SAE specifications while enhancing safety and performance.
